nodejs does not support lot of ES6 features

js itself does not kno how to compile the ES6
there is a middle person or library named babel do this work for them
Eg import ,export, let, const and arrow functions

babel will convert ES6 to native js

npm install @babel/preset-env @babel/cli @babel/node  --save-dev
